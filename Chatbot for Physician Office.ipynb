The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breast-feeding. Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.\n",

      "Nipple changes Open pop-up dialog box Close Nipple changes Nipple changes Breast and nipple changes can be a sign of breast cancer. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice anything unusual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue\n",
      "\n",
      "Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast\n",

      "\n",
      "Causes\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inherited breast cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified. The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history. A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk factors\n",
      "\n",
      "A breast cancer risk factor is anything that makes it more likely you'll get breast cancer. But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop breast cancer. Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women.\n",
      "\n",

to other parts of the body.', 'Where breast cancer begins in men\\n\\nEveryone is born with a small amount of breast tissue.', 'Breast tissue consists of milk-producing glands (lobules), ducts that carry milk to the nipples, and fat.', 'During puberty, women begin developing more breast tissue, and men do not.', 'But because men are born with a small amount of breast tissue, they can develop

instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous.', 'What do gene mutations do?', 'A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to:\\n\\nAllow rapid

lack of exercise.', 'Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth.', 'However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake.', 'Occasionally, a mistake is missed.', 'This could cause a cell to become cancerous.', 'How do gene mutations interact with each other?', \"The gene mutations you're born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer.\", \"For instance, if you've inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn't mean you're certain to get cancer.\", 'Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer.', 'Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance.', \"It's not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form.\", \"It's likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \"Risk factors\\n\\nWhile doctors have an idea of what may

older than age 65) or two drinks a day (for men age 65 and younger), excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer.', 'You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others.', 'Your family history\\n\\nOnly a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition.', \"If cancer is common in your family, it's possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next.\", 'You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you
